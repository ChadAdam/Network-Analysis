# Game of Thrones Network Analysis 
For this project I will be using Pandas/Numpy to explore and manipulate all the character interactions to find the Game of Thrones characters who are most important. I will then analyze how the characters interact with eachother using Networkx.

The data for this project comes from https://github.com/mathbeveridge/gameofthrones and is a collection of data for season 1 to season 7. For each season the data is further separated by Edge and Node CSV files.
